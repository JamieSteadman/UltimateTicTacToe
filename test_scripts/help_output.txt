Usage: ./grid 

This program creates a 9x9 grid GTK application with a grid of buttons.
Each button represents a cell in a 9x9 grid, organized into nine 3x3 subgrids.

When you click on a button, it alternates between 'X' and 'O', simulating a game turn.
The buttons are indexed such that buttons[i][j], where:
    - 'i' (0-8) represents the subgrid index (one of the nine 3x3 grids).
    - 'j' (0-8) represents the box index within that subgrid.

Run the program:
    ./grid

Optional Flags:
    --help
Example Usage:
    ./grid
    (Launches the GTK application with the 9x9 grid interface)

Note:
    - Ensure that GTK 3 development libraries are installed on your system.
    - The application window displays a 9x9 grid with thicker borders outlining the nine 3x3 subgrids.
    - Clicking on a button will place an 'X' or 'O', alternating each turn.
    - The buttons become disabled after being clicked to prevent multiple selections.
